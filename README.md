# Project Description

This project follows the Go Clean Architecture pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and maintainability. The architecture consists of several layers, including the presentation layer, use case layer, and data layer.

The image above illustrates the high-level structure of the Go Clean Architecture. It shows how the different layers interact with each other and the flow of data throughout the system.
